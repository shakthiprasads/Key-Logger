# KeyLogger: System Monitoring and Logging Tool

---

## **Overview**
KeyLogger is a Python-based application designed to monitor and log various system activities. This tool demonstrates capabilities like recording keystrokes, capturing clipboard content, gathering system information, and taking webcam snapshots. It serves as an educational project to understand the implementation of logging mechanisms and cryptography.

## **Features**

### Logging Capabilities
1. **Keystroke Logging**: Records user keystrokes and encrypts the log.
2. **Clipboard Monitoring**: Captures clipboard content.
3. **System Information Gathering**: Retrieves and stores system details.
4. **Webcam Capture**: Captures images using the system's webcam.

### Encryption
- All logs (e.g., keystrokes, system info) are encrypted to ensure secure storage.

### Output
- Logs and captured data are stored in encrypted files (e.g., `e_key_log.txt`, `e_systeminfo.txt`).
